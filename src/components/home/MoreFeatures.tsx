          <h4 className="mt-0 font-normal">Automatic failover</h4>
          <p>
            Workflows or individual services can automatically be retried in
            case of an error, and crashed workflows can be resumed without
            information loss.

          <h4 className="mt-0 font-normal">Cyclic workflows</h4>
          <p>
            Submit cyclic workflow graphs without a priori runtime knowledge.
            Workflows are converted incrementally and on-demand to so-called
            process chains.

          <p>
            Custom runtimes allow your team to develop microservices in various
            programming languages and with different frameworks. This allows you
            to focus on the task at hand.

          <p>
            Use the REST-like HTTP interface in your applications to submit
            workflows or to fetch information during execution. Write your own
            plugins to customize Steep.
