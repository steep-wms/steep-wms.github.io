### Example workflows

In this section, we describe example workflows covering patterns we regularly
see in real-world use cases. For each workflow, we also provide the required
service metadata. For more information about the <ScrollLink href="#workflows">workflow model</ScrollLink>
and <ScrollLink href="#service-metadata">service metadata</ScrollLink>, please read
the section on <ScrollLink href="#data-models">data models</ScrollLink>.

#### Running two services in parallel

This example workflow consists of two actions that each copy a file. Since both
actions do not depend on each other (i.e. they do not share any variable), Steep
converts them to two independent process chains and executes them in parallel
(as long as there are at least two agents available).

The workflow defines four variables. `inputFile1` and `inputFile1` point to the
two files to be copied. `outputFile1` and `outputFile2` have no value. Steep
will create unique values (output file names) for them during the workflow
execution.

The workflow then specifies two execute actions for the `copy` service. The
service metadata of `copy` defines that this processing service has an input
parameter `input_file` and an output parameter `output_file`, both of which
must be specified exactly one time (`cardinality` equals `1..1`).

For each execute action, Steep assigns the input variables to the input
parameters, generates file names for the output variables, and then executes the
processing services.
