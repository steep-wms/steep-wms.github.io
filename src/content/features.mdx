<Features title="Key features">
  <Feature icon={<icons.Cloud />} title="Distributed">

Dynamic and scalable execution of data-driven workflows in a distributed
environment such as the Cloud.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.RotateCw />} title="Cyclic workflow graphs">

Support for cyclic workflow graphs without a priori runtime knowledge.
Workflows are converted incrementally and on-demand to so-called process
chains.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Clock />} title="Capability-based scheduling">

Optimized, capability-based process chain scheduling through
parallelization and distribution to multiple agents (i.e. Steep instances
running in the Cloud or in a cluster).

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Repeat />} title="Automatic failover">

Crashed workflows can be resumed without loss of information (even without
a database).

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Cpu />} title="Microservice integration">

Service metadata allows microservices (also called processing services)
with almost arbitrary interfaces to be integrated/executed.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Target />} title="Runtime environments">

Built-in runtime environments for executable microservices that are
provided as binaries or Docker images.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Package />} title="Plugins">

Plugins let you modify generated process chains, the way agents collect
results, or add custom runtime environments (e.g. Python, AWS Lambda, Web
Processing Services).

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Database />} title="Optional databases">

If you want your workflows to be persisted in a database over a long
period of time, Steep offers support for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Monitor />} title="HTTP and web interfaces">

Steep has a REST-like HTTP interface, a web-based user interface for
monitoring, and can provide metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Grid />} title="Kubernetes">

Tight integration with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) enables optimized
resource usage through auto-scaling.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Server />} title="OpenStack">

The [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) Cloud Connector allows virtual
machines hosting additional Steep agents to be created on demand.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.TrendingUp />} title="Scalability">

Its asynchronous event-driven architecture allows Steep to scale
horizontally across multiple machines in your cluster and to support
complex dynamic workflows with thousands of tasks.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.Truck />} title="Production-ready">

Steep is very reliable and has been used in production for many years to
execute workflows from various domains. The source code has a very high
test coverage.

  </Feature>
  <Feature icon={<icons.GitHub />} title="Open-Source">

Steep is free and open-source. It is released under the
[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The
code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/steep-wms/steep).
