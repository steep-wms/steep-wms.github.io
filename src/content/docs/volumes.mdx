This data model describes an additional volume that can be attached to a
virtual machine specified by a <DocsLink href="#setups">setup</DocsLink>.

| Property                               | Type    | Description
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | -----------
| sizeGb<br/>*(required)*                | number  | The volume's size in gigabytes
| type<br/>*(optional)*                  | string  | Type the volume's type. By default, the type will be selected automatically.
| availabilityZone<br/>*(optional)*      | string  | The availability zone in which to create the volume. By default, it will be created in the same availability zone as the VM to which it will be attached.
| deviceName<br/>*(optional)*            | string  | The device name under which the volume will be exposed to the operating system on the virtual machine (e.g. `/dev/sdb`). Please note that this value is mandatory for some cloud providers, while for others, it is optional and they automatically assign a name. Some even ignore this value completely (e.g. OpenStack). Also, some cloud providers only accept names that correspond to a specific scheme. Please refer to your cloud provider's documentation on whether specifying a name is mandatory and which values are considered valid.
