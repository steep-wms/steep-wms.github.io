Next, we need to define the metadata for our new service. Open the file `conf/services/services.yaml` and add the following code:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: countdown
  name: Count Down
  description: Read a number, subtract 1, and write the result
  path: ./countdown.js  # change if necessary
  runtime: other

  parameters:
    - id: input
      name: Input file
      description: The input file containing the number to decrease
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: file

    - id: output
      name: Output file
      description: The path to the output file
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: fileOrEmptyList
```
</CodeContainer>

Change the `path` attribute to the absolute location of the `countdown.js` file on your system.

Note that we use the data type `fileOrEmptyList` for the service's output parameter. This is a special data type that either returns the generated file or an empty list if the file does not exist. Using the data type `file` would lead to an error during workflow execution.

Don't forget to restart Steep for the changes to take effect.
