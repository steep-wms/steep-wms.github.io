Fetches information about a run of a <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chain</DocsLink>.

The path parameter `runNumber` specifies the number of the run to return. Run
numbers start at `1` in continuously increasing order. The process chain property
`totalRuns` specifies how many runs the process chain has.

This endpoint renders a view of a process chain for the run with the given
`runNumber`. It renders objects similar to the ones returned by the <DocsLink href="#get-process-chain-by-id">`/processchains/:id` endpoint</DocsLink>.
If `runNumber` equals `totalRuns`, both endpoints return the exact same object
(because <DocsLink href="#get-process-chain-by-id">`/processchains/:id`</DocsLink>
always renders the latest run).
