After Steep's cloud manager has created a VM, it uploads the provisioning
scripts defined in the corresponding <DocsLink href="#setups">setup</DocsLink>
to the VM and executes them. The scripts can be used to deploy software to the
VM and to make sure all required services (including Steep) are running.

Each provisioning script is a simple executable script file with a valid UNIX
shebang at the beginning.

Script files will be processed by a [template engine](https://pebbletemplates.io/)
before they are uploaded. The following sections describe supported template
instructions.
