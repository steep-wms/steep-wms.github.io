<dl>
<dt>`steep.controller.enabled`</dt>
<dd>
`true` if the controller should be enabled. Set this value to `false` if your
Steep instance does not have access to the shared database.

**Default:** `true`
</dd>

<dt>`steep.controller.lookupInterval`</dt>
<dd>
The interval at which the controller looks for accepted submissions,
specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>.

**Default:** 2s
</dd>

<dt>`steep.controller.lookupMaxErrors`</dt>
<dd>
The maximum number of consecutive errors (e.g. database connection issues) to
tolerate when looking up the status of process chains of a running submission.
If there are more errors, the submission will be aborted.

**Default:** 5
</dd>

<dt>`steep.controller.lookupOrphansInterval`</dt>
<dd>
The interval at which the controller looks for orphaned running submissions
(i.e. submissions that are in the status `RUNNING` but that are currently not
being processed by any controller instance), specified as a
<DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>. If Steep finds such a
submission it will try to resume it.

**Default:** 5m
</dd>

<dt>`steep.controller.lookupOrphansInitialDelay`</dt>
<dd>
The time the controller should wait after startup before it looks for
orphaned running submissions for the first time (specified as a
<DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>). This property is useful
if you want to implement a rolling update from one Steep instance to another.

**Default:** 0s
</dd>
