`steep.controller.enabled`

> `true` if the controller should be enabled. Set this value to `false` if your
> Steep instance does not have access to the shared database.

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.controller.lookupInterval`

> The interval at which the controller looks for accepted submissions,
> specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>.

> **Default:** 2s

`steep.controller.lookupMaxErrors`

> The maximum number of consecutive errors (e.g. database connection issues) to
> tolerate when looking up the status of process chains of a running submission.
> If there are more errors, the submission will be aborted.

> **Default:** 5

`steep.controller.lookupOrphansInterval`

> The interval at which the controller looks for orphaned running submissions
> (i.e. submissions that are in the status `RUNNING` but that are currently not
> being processed by any controller instance), specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>. If Steep finds such a
> submission it will try to resume it.

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.controller.lookupOrphansInitialDelay`

> The time the controller should wait after startup before it looks for
> orphaned running submissions for the first time (specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>). This property is useful
> if you want to implement a rolling update from one Steep instance to another.

> **Default:** 0s
