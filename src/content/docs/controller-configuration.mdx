`steep.controller.enabled`

> `true` if the controller should be enabled. Set this value to `false` if your
> Steep instance does not have access to the shared database.

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.controller.lookupIntervalMilliseconds`

> The interval at which the controller looks for accepted submissions

> **Default:** 2000 (2 seconds)

`steep.controller.lookupOrphansIntervalMilliseconds`

> The interval at which the controller looks for orphaned running submissions
> (i.e. submissions that are in the status `RUNNING` but that are currently not
> being processed by any controller instance). If Steep finds such a submission
> it will try to resume it.

> **Default:** 300000 (5 minutes)

`steep.controller.lookupOrphansInitialDelayMilliseconds`

> The number of milliseconds the controller should wait after startup before
> it looks for orphaned running submissions for the first time. This property
> is useful if you want to implement a rolling update from one Steep
> instance to another.

> **Default:** 0
