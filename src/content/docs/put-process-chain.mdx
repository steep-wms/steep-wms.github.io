import ScrollLink from "../../components/ScrollLink"

Update a <ScrollLink href="#process-chains">process chain</ScrollLink>. The request
body is a JSON object with the process chain properties to update. At the
moment, only the `status` property can be updated.

If the operation was successful, the response body contains
the updated process chain without the properties `executables` and `results`.

Note: You can use this endpoint to cancel the execution of a process chain (see
example below).
