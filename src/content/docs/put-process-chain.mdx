Update a <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chain</DocsLink>. The request
body is a JSON object with the process chain properties to update. At the
moment, only the `status` and `priority` properties can be updated.

If the operation was successful, the response body contains
the updated process chain without the properties `executables` and `results`.

Notes:
* You can use this endpoint to cancel the execution of a process chain (see
  example below).
* The priority can only be modified if the <DocsLink href="#process-chain-status">process chain status</DocsLink>
  is `REGISTERED`, `RUNNING`, or `PAUSED`. Otherwise, the operation will result in HTTP error 422.
