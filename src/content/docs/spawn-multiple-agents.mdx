By default, every Steep instance spawns only one agent. You can configure the number of agents in the <DocsLink href="#steepyaml">general configuration file</DocsLink> `conf/steep.yaml`. For example, the following configuration will spawn 12 agents:

<CodeContainer title="conf/steep.yaml">
```yaml
steep:
  agents:
    instances: 12
```
</CodeContainer>

Restart Steep for the changes to take effect. Then, open the 'Agents' tab in Steep's UI to see the list of agents: http://localhost:8080/agents

You may also access Steep's HTTP API:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/agents
```
</CodeContainer>
