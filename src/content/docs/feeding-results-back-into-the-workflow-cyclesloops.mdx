The following example shows how to create loops with a dynamic number of
iterations. Suppose there is a processing service called `countdown.js` that
reads a number from an input file, decreases this number by 1, and then writes
the result to an output file. The service could be implemented in Node.js
as follows:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const fs = require("fs").promises

async function countDown(input, output) {
  let value = parseInt(await fs.readFile(input, "utf-8"))
  console.log(`Old value: ${value}`)

  value--
  if (value > 0) {
    console.log(`New value: ${value}`)
    await fs.writeFile(output, "" + value, "utf-8")
  } else {
    console.log("No new value")
  }
}

countDown(process.argv[2], process.argv[3])
```

The following workflow uses this service in a for-each action to continuously
reprocess a file and decrease the number in it until it reaches 0.

In the first iteration of the for-each action, the service reads from a file called
`input.txt` and writes to an output file with a name generated during runtime.
The path of this output file is routed back into the for-each action via
`yieldToInput`. In the second iteration, the service reads from the output file
and produces another one. This process continues until the number equals 0.
In this case, the service does not write an output file anymore and the
workflow finishes.

Note that we use the data type `fileOrEmptyList` in the service metadata for the
output parameter of the `countdown` service. This is a special data type that
either returns the generated file or an empty list if the file does not exist.
In the latter case, the for-each action does not have any more input values to
process. Think of the `input` of a for-each action as a queue. If nothing is
pushed into the queue and all elements have already been processed, the for-each
action can finish.
