Use these configuration items to build up a cluster of Steep instances. Under
the hood, Steep uses [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) and [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/),
so these configuration items are very similar to the ones found in these two
frameworks. To build up a cluster, you need to configure an event bus connection
and a cluster connection. They should use different ports. `host` typically
refers to the machine your instance is running on and `publicHost` or
`publicAddress` specify the hostname or IP address that your Steep instance will
use in your network to advertise itself so that other instances can connect to
it.

For more information, please read the documentation of [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/)
and [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/).

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`host`

> The IP address (or hostname) to bind the clustered eventbus to

> **Default:** Automatically detected local network interface

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`port`

> The port the clustered eventbus should listen on

> **Default:** A random port

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`publicHost`

> The IP address (or hostname) the eventbus uses to announce itself within in the cluster

> **Default:** Same as `steep.`<wbr />`cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`host`

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`publicPort`

> The port that the eventbus uses to announce itself within in the cluster

> **Default:** Same as `steep.`<wbr />`cluster.`<wbr />`eventBus.`<wbr />`port`

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`hazelcast.`<wbr />`publicAddress`

> The IP address (or hostname) and port Hazelcast uses to announce itself within in the cluster

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`hazelcast.`<wbr />`port`

> The port that Hazelcast should listen on

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`hazelcast.`<wbr />`interfaces`

> A list of IP address patterns specifying valid interfaces Hazelcast should bind to

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`hazelcast.`<wbr />`members`

> A list of IP addresses (or hostnames) of Hazelcast cluster members

`steep.cluster.`<wbr />`hazelcast.`<wbr />`tcpEnabled`

> `true` if Hazelcast should use TCP to connect to other instances, `false` if it should use multicast

> **Default:** `false`
