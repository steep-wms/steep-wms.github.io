<dl>
<dt>`steep.runtimes.docker.env`</dt>
<dd>
Additional environment variables that will be passed to containers created by the Docker runtime

**Example:** `["key=value", "foo=bar"]`

**Default:** `[]` (empty list)
</dd>

<dt>`steep.runtimes.docker.pull`</dt>
<dd>
Defines if the Docker runtime should pull the image before running a container

**Default:** `auto`

###### Valid values:

* `always` - Always pull the image before running, regardless of whether it is already present locally or not.
* `missing` - Only pull the image if it is not present locally.
* `never` - Never pull the image. If it is not present locally, the operation will fail.
* `auto` - Automatically decide whether to pull the image or not based on the following criteria (in this order):
  * If an image digest is given, the Docker runtime will behave as if the value were equal to `missing`
  * If an image tag is given that is not `latest`, the Docker runtime will behave as if the value were equal to `missing`
  * If an image tag is given and it is `latest`, the Docker runtime will behave as if the value was `always`
  * If no image tag is given, the Docker runtime will behave as if the value was `always`
</dd>

<dt>`steep.runtimes.docker.volumes`</dt>
<dd>
Additional volume mounts to be passed to the Docker runtime

**Example:** `["/data:/data"]`

**Default:** `[]` (empty list)
