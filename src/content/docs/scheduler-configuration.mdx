`steep.scheduler.enabled`

> `true` if the scheduler should be enabled. Set this value to `false` if your
> Steep instance does not have access to the shared database.

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.scheduler.lookupInterval`

> The interval at which the scheduler looks for registered process chains,
> specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>.

> **Default:** 20s

`steep.scheduler.lookupOrphansInterval`

> The interval at which the scheduler looks for orphaned running process chains
> (i.e. process chains that are in the status `RUNNING` but that are currently
> not being processed by any scheduler instance), specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>. Note that the scheduler
> also always looks for orphaned process chains when it detects that another
> scheduler instance has just left the cluster (regardless of the configured
> interval).

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.scheduler.lookupOrphansInitialDelay`

> The time the scheduler should wait after startup before it looks for orphaned
> running process chains for the first time (specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>). This property is useful
> if you want to implement a rolling update from one Steep instance to another.
> Note that the scheduler also looks for orphaned process chains when another
> scheduler instance has just left the cluster, even if the initial delay has
> not passed by yet.

> **Default:** 0s
