`steep.scheduler.enabled`

> `true` if the scheduler should be enabled. Set this value to `false` if your
> Steep instance does not have access to the shared database.

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.scheduler.lookupIntervalMilliseconds`

> The interval in which the scheduler looks for registered process chains

> **Default:** 20000 (20 seconds)

`steep.scheduler.lookupOrphansIntervalMilliseconds`

> The interval at which the scheduler looks for orphaned running process chains
> (i.e. process chains that are in the status `RUNNING` but that are currently
> not being processed by any scheduler instance). Note that the scheduler also
> always looks for orphaned process chains when it detects that another
> scheduler instance has just left the cluster (regardless of the configured
> interval).

> **Default:** 300000 (5 minutes)

`steep.scheduler.lookupOrphansInitialDelayMilliseconds`

> The number of milliseconds the scheduler should wait after startup before
> it looks for orphaned running process chains for the first time. This
> property is useful if you want to implement a rolling update from one Steep
> instance to another. Note that the scheduler also looks for orphaned
> process chains when another scheduler instance has just left the cluster,
> even if the initial delay has not passed by yet.

> **Default:** 0
