Steep can be extended through plugins. In this section, we will describe the
interfaces of all plugins and how they need to be configured so Steep can
compile and execute them at runtime.

Each plugin is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) script with the file
extension `.kt` or `.kts`. Inside this script, there should be a single function
with the same name as the plugin and a signature that depends on the plugin type.
Function interfaces are described in the sub-sections below.

All plugins must be referenced in the <DocsLink href="#pluginscommonyaml">plugins/common.yaml</DocsLink> file. This file is an array of descriptor objects with at least the following
properties:

| Property                    | Type   | Description
| --------------------------- | ------ | -----------
| name<br/>*(required)*       | string | A unique name of the plugin (the function inside the plugin's script file must have the same name)
| type<br/>*(required)*       | string | The plugin type. Valid values are: `initializer`, `outputAdapter`, `processChainAdapter`, `processChainConsistencyChecker`, and `runtime`.
| scriptFile<br/>*(required)* | string | The path to the plugin's Kotlin script file. The file should have the extension `.kt` or `.kts`. The path is relative to Steep's application directory, so a valid example is `conf/plugins/fileOrEmptyList.kt`.
| version<br/>*(optional)*    | string | The plugin's version. Must follow the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/).

Specific plugin types may require additional properties described in the
sub-sections below.

Plugins are compiled on demand when Steep is starting. This can take some time
depending on the number of the plugins and their size. For faster start times,
you can configure a <DocsLink href="#cache-configuration">persistent compiled plugin cache</DocsLink>.
Steep updates this cache on startup when it has first compiled a script or when
it detects that a previously compiled script has changed. On subsequent startups,
Steep can utilize the cache to skip compilation of known plugins and, therefore,
to reduce startup time.
