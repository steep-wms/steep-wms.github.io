Plugins are compiled on demand when Steep is starting. This can take some time
depending on the number of the plugins and their size. For faster start times,
you can also precompile them.

When Steep looks for a plugin script file (with file extension `.kt`), it also
checks if there is a precompiled class file in the same directory. For example,
if your plugin is called `myCoolPlugin`, Steep will also try to load a class
`MyCoolPluginKt` from the directory where `myCoolPlugin.kt` is located.

This class should contain a *static* method called `myCoolPlugin`, which
represents the plugin's entry point as described in the sections above.

To create the class name, Steep converts the first character of the plugin's
name to uppercase and appends the suffix `Kt`. This is the same thing the
Kotlin compiler does when it compiles a file with the extension `.kt`. It is
therefore recommended that your plugin script file has the suffix `.kt` (and
not `.kts`), because then (and only then), the Kotlin compiler will
automatically create a compatible class file (with the correct name and with a
static method).
