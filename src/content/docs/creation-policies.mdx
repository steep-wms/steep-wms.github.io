A creation policy defines rules for creating VMs from a certain setup.

| Property                            | Type     | Description
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -----------
| retries<br/>*(optional)*            | object   | An optional <DocsLink href="#retry-policies">retry policy</DocsLink> that specifies how many attempts should be made to create a VM (if creation fails) as well as possible (exponential) delays between those attempts. If this property is `null`, default values from the <DocsLink href="#steepyaml">`steep.yaml`</DocsLink> file will be used.
| lockAfterRetries<br/>*(optional)*   | <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink> | When the maximum number of attempts to create a VM from a certain <DocsLink href="#setups">setup</DocsLink> has been reached, the setup will be locked and no other VM with this setup will be created. This property defines how long it will stay locked.
