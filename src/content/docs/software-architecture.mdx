The following figure shows the main components of Steep: the HTTP server,
the controller, the scheduler, the agent, and the cloud manager.

Together, these components form an instance of Steep. In practice, each
instance typically runs on a separate virtual machine, but multiple instances
can also be started on the same machine. Each component can be enabled or
disabled in a given instance (see <DocsLink href="#steepyaml">configuration options</DocsLink> 
for more information). This means, in a cluster, there can be instances
that have all five components enabled, and others that only have an agent,
for example.

All components of all instances communicate with each other through messages
sent over an event bus. Further, the HTTP server, the controller, and the
scheduler are able to connect to a shared database.

The HTTP server provides information about scheduled, running, and finished
workflows to clients. Clients can also upload a new workflow. In such a case,
the HTTP server puts the workflow into the database and sends a message to one
of the instances of the controller.

The controller receives this message, loads the workflow from the database,
and starts transforming it iteratively to process chains as
described <DocsLink href="#workflow-scheduling">above</DocsLink>.
Whenever it has generated new process chains, it puts them into the database
and sends a message to all instances of the scheduler.

The schedulers then select agents to execute the process chains. They load the
process chains from the database, send them via the event bus to the selected
agents for execution, and finally write the results into the database. The
schedulers also send a message back to the controller so it can continue with
the next iteration and generate more process chains until the workflow has been
completely transformed.

In case a scheduler does not find an agent suitable for the execution of a
process chain, it sends a message to the cloud manager (a component that
interacts with the API of the Cloud infrastructure) and asks it to create a
new agent.
