Upload one or more local files to the remote VM.

```handlebars
{{ upload("source", "destination") }}
```

`source` may contain a glob pattern (e.g. `*.sh` or `**/*.yaml`) if you want to
upload multiple files or if you want to recursively transfer a whole directory
tree. In this case, `destination` should be a directory and it should exist.

```handlebars
#!/usr/bin/env bash

mkdir -p /etc/steep
{{ upload("conf/**/*.yaml", "/etc/steep") }}
```
