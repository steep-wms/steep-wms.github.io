As described <ScrollLink href="#workflow-scheduling">above</ScrollLink>, Steep
transforms a workflow to one or more *process chains*. A process chain is a
sequential list of instructions that will be sent to Steep's remote agents to
execute processing services in a distributed environment.

| Property                              | Type   | Description
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | -----------
| id<br/>*(required)*                   | string | Unique process chain identifier
| executables<br/>*(required)*          | array  | A list of <ScrollLink href="#executables">executable objects</ScrollLink> that describe what processing services should be called and with which arguments
| submissionId<br/>*(required)*         | string | The ID of the <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission</ScrollLink> to which this process chain belongs
| startTime<br/>*(optional)*            | string | An ISO 8601 timestamp denoting the date and time when the process chain execution was started. May be `null` if the execution has not started yet.
| endTime<br/>*(optional)*              | string | An ISO 8601 timestamp denoting the date and time when the process chain execution finished. May be `null` if the execution has not finished yet.
| status<br/>*(required)*               | string | The current <ScrollLink href="#process-chain-status">status</ScrollLink> of the process chain
| requiredCapabilities<br/>*(optional)* | array  | A set of strings specifying capabilities a host system must provide to be able to execute this process chain. See also <ScrollLink href="#setups">setups</ScrollLink>.
| results<br/>*(optional)*              | object | If `status` is `SUCCESS`, this property contains the list of process chain result files grouped by their output variable ID. Otherwise, it is `null`.
| estimatedProgress<br />*(optional)*   | number | A floating point number between `0.0` (0%) and `1.0` (100%) indicating the current execution progress of this process chain. This property will only be provided if the process chain is currently being executed (i.e. if its `status` equals `RUNNING`) and if a progress could actually be estimated. Note that the value is an estimation based on various factors and does not have to represent the real progress. More precise values can be calculated with a <ScrollLink href="#progress-estimators">progress estimator plugin</ScrollLink>. Sometimes, progress cannot be estimated at all. In this case, the value will be `null`.
| errorMessage<br/>*(optional)*         | string | If `status` is `ERROR`, this property contains a human-readable error message. Otherwise, it is `null`.
