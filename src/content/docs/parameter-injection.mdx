For compatibility reasons, the plugin function signatures described above are
not fixed. Whenever a plugin function is called, its arguments are injected
based on their type. For example, if the function requires an instance of
`io.vertx.core.Vertx`, such an object will be passed. This is independent of
where this argument appears in the parameter list. In the function signatures
described above, the Vert.x instance is always the last parameter, but actually,
it could be at any position and the injection mechanism would still work.

This feature allows us as developers to add new parameters in the future to
the function signatures without requiring all users to change their plugins.
It also allows plugin developers to specify parameters in any order and
to even leave out parameters if they are not needed. For example,
a <ScrollLink href="#process-chain-adapters">process chain adapter</ScrollLink>
could also have the following signature:

```kotlin
fun myProcessChainAdapter(workflow: Workflow)
```

Note that a parameter can only be injected into a plugin of a certain type,
if it is described in the function signature of this plugin type above. For
example, the function signature of a <ScrollLink href="#custom-runtime-environments">runtime plugin</ScrollLink>
does not specify a <ScrollLink href="#workflows">workflow</ScrollLink>, so a
workflow cannot be injected. Trying to define a runtime plugin with such a
parameter will result in an error.
