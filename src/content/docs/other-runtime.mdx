**Name:** `other`

The `other` runtime is the default runtime of Steep. The service will be
executed like a normal executable program on the same host as the Steep agent.

The `path` attribute of the service metadata refers to the program to execute.
It can either be an absolute path to an executable binary or shell script
or a name of a built-in shell function.
