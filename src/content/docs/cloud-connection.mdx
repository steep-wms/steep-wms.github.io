> A metadata tag that should be attached to virtual machines to indicate that
> they have been created by Steep

`steep.cloud.setupsFile`

> The path to the file that describes all available <ScrollLink href="#setups">setups</ScrollLink>. See <ScrollLink href="setupsyaml">setups.yaml</ScrollLink>.

`steep.cloud.syncIntervalSeconds`

> **Default:** 120 (2 minutes)

`steep.cloud.keepAliveIntervalSeconds`

`steep.cloud.timeouts.agentReadySeconds`
