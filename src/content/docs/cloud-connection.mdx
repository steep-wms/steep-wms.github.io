`steep.cloud.enabled`

> `true` if Steep should connect to a cloud to acquire remote agents on demand

> **Default:** `false`

`steep.cloud.driver`

`steep.cloud.createdByTag`

> A metadata tag that should be attached to virtual machines to indicate that
> they have been created by Steep

`steep.cloud.syncInterval`

> The time that should pass before the cloud manager synchronizes its internal
> state with the cloud again, specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>.

> **Default:** 2m

`steep.cloud.keepAliveInterval`

> The time that should pass before the cloud manager sends keep-alive messages
> to a minimum of remote agents again (so that they do not shut down themselves),
> specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>. See

`steep.cloud.setups.file`

> The path to the file that describes all available
> <DocsLink href="#setups">setups</DocsLink>. See
> <DocsLink href="setupsyaml">setups.yaml</DocsLink>.

`steep.cloud.setups.creation.retries`

> A <DocsLink href="#retry-policies">retry policy</DocsLink> that specifies
> how many attempts should be made to create a VM from a certain
> <DocsLink href="#setups">setup</DocsLink> (if creation fails) as well as
> possible (exponential) delays between those attempts.

> **Default:**

> ```yaml
> retries:
>   maxAttempts: 5
>   delay: 40s
>   exponentialBackoff: 2

`steep.cloud.setups.lockAfterRetries`

> When the maximum number of attempts to create a VM from a certain
> <DocsLink href="#setups">setup</DocsLink> has been reached (see
> `steep.cloud.setups.creation.retries`), the setup will be locked and no other
> VM with this setup will be created. This parameter defines how long it will be
> locked, specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>.

> **Default:** 20m

`steep.cloud.timeouts.sshReady`

> The maximum time the cloud manager should try to log in to a new VM via SSH
> (specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>).
> The cloud manager will make a login attempt every 2 seconds until it is
> successful or until the maximum number of seconds have passed, in which
> case it will destroy the VM.

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.cloud.timeouts.agentReady`

> The maximum time the cloud manager should wait for an agent on a new VM to
> become available (i.e. how long a new Steep instance may take to register
> with the cluster) before it destroys the VM again (specified as a
> <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>).

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.cloud.timeouts.createVM`

> The maximum time that creating a VM may take before it is aborted with an

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.cloud.timeouts.destroyVM`

> The maximum time that destroying a VM may take before it is aborted with an
> error (specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>).

> **Default:** 5m

`steep.cloud.agentPool`

> An array of <DocsLink href="#agent-pool-parameters">agent pool parameters</DocsLink>
> describing how many remote agents the cloud manager should keep in its pool
> how many it is allowed to create for each given set of capabilities.

> **Default:** `[]` (empty list)
