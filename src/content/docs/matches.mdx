A match object specifies a which property of an item has matched with which search term and where the match has occurred.

| Property                  | Type   | Description
| ------------------------- | ------ | -----------
| locator                   | string | The property in which the match was found. Possible values are `errorMessage`, `id`, `name`, `requiredCapabilities`, `source`, `status`, `startTime`, `endTime`. See the description of the <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission</ScrollLink> and <ScrollLink href="#process-chains">process chain</ScrollLink> data models for more information about these properties.
| fragment                  | string | A fragment of the property's value (an 'excerpt' or a 'preview'). If the property's value is small enough, the fragment might even contain the whole value.
| termMatches               | array  | A list of matches within `fragment` (see below)

`termMatches` is an array of objects with the following properties:

| Property                  | Type   | Description
| ------------------------- | ------ | -----------
| term                      | string | The matched term from the search query
| indices                   | array  | The start positions (relative to `fragment`) at which the term was found
