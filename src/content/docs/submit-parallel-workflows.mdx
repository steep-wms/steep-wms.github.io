<DocsLink href="#submit-the-workflow">Submit the workflows</DocsLink> from above to Steep and familiarize yourself with how it converts them to process chains and what directories and files it generates in the output directory.

Visit the workflow page in Steep's web UI (http://localhost:8080/workflows) and click on the ID of your submitted workflow. It should display two process chains, one for each downloaded file.

List the contents of Steep's output directory for this workflow:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
ls /tmp/steep/out/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>

You should find two sub-directories, one for each extract action output.
