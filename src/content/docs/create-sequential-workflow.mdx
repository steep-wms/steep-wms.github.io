Create a new file `download.yaml` and paste the following workflow into it:

<CodeContainer title="download.yaml">
```yaml generate-json
api: 4.6.0
actions:
  - type: execute
    service: download
    inputs:
      - id: url
        value: https://github.com/steep-wms/steep-wms.github.io/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    outputs:
      - id: output_file
        var: o1

  - type: execute
    service: extract
    inputs:
      - id: input_file
        var: o1
    outputs:
      - id: destination_directory
        var: output_directory
        store: true
```
</CodeContainer>

The workflow consists of two <DocsLink href="#execute-actions">execute actions</DocsLink> calling the `download` and the `extract` service. It downloads the source code of this website from GitHub and extracts it into Steep's output directory.

Steep is able to automatically detect the dependency between the two actions based on their inputs and outputs.
The output of the `download` action is stored in the variable `o1`, which is in turn used as input for the `extract` action. This tells Steep to execute the download action first, wait for it to finish, and then execute the extract action.
