This example workflow consists of two execute actions that each copy a file.
Since both actions do not depend on each other (i.e. they do not share any
variable), Steep converts them to two independent process chains and executes
them in parallel (as long as there are at least two agents available).

The two execute actions refer to the `copy` service. The service metadata of
`copy` defines that this processing service has an input parameter `input_file`
and an output parameter `output_file`, both of which must be specified exactly
one time (`cardinality` equals `1..1`).

The input parameters are given (`example1.txt` and `example2.txt`). The output
parameters refer to the variables `outputFile1` and `outputFile2` and have no
value. Steep will create unique values (output file names) for them during
workflow execution.
