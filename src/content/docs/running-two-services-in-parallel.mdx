This example workflow consists of two actions that each copy a file. Since both
actions do not depend on each other (i.e. they do not share any variable), Steep
converts them to two independent process chains and executes them in parallel
(as long as there are at least two agents available).

The workflow defines four variables. `inputFile1` and `inputFile2` point to the
two files to be copied. `outputFile1` and `outputFile2` have no value. Steep
will create unique values (output file names) for them during the workflow
execution.

The workflow then specifies two execute actions for the `copy` service. The
service metadata of `copy` defines that this processing service has an input
parameter `input_file` and an output parameter `output_file`, both of which
must be specified exactly one time (`cardinality` equals `1..1`).

For each execute action, Steep assigns the input variables to the input
parameters, generates file names for the output variables, and then executes the
processing services.
