In this tutorial, we are going to create a workflow that downloads a `.zip` file from an HTTP server and then extracts it. For this, we will use the `wget` and `unzip` programs. Similar to the <DocsLink href="#your-first-workflow">first tutorial</DocsLink>, we need to add service metadata for these services to the `conf/services/services.yaml` file.

First, add the following metadata for the `wget` service:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: download
  name: Download
  description: Download a file from a HTTP server
  path: wget
  runtime: other

  parameters:
    - id: output_file
      name: Output file
      description: The target file to which to download
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      label: -O
      fileSuffix: .zip
      dataType: file

    - id: url
      name: URL
      description: The URL of the file to download
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string
```
</CodeContainer>

Similar to the `cp` service from the first tutorial, this service has two parameters. However, in this case, the output parameter has been specified first and has a label `-O`. Steep will respect the order of the parameters and the label when calling `wget` later during workflow execution and generate a command line in the following form:

```text
wget -O <output_file> <url>
```

The output parameter also has a `fileSuffix`. Specifying this will make sure Steep generates an output filename with the correct extension (in this case `.zip`) later during workflow execution.

Next, we need to add the metadata for the `unzip` service:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: extract
  name: Extract
  description: Extract a ZIP archive
  path: unzip
  runtime: other

  parameters:
    - id: input_file
      name: Input file
      description: The archive to extract
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: file

    - id: destination_directory
      name: Destination
      description: >-
        The destination directory to which the archive
        should be extracted
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      label: -d
      dataType: directory
```
</CodeContainer>

In this case, the output parameter has a label `-d` and is a directory. Steep
is able to automatically create output directories during workflow execution.
