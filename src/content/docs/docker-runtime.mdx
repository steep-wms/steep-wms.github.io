**Name:** `docker`

This runtime executes the service through Docker.

The service metadata attribute `path` specifies the Docker image to run. It can
be an image name followed by an optional tag and/or digest (e.g. `ubuntu` or
`ubuntu:23.10`).

The attribute `runtimeArgs` specifies parameters that should be forwarded to the
`docker run` command. For example, the following runtime argument mounts a
volume to the started container:

```yaml
runtimeArgs:
  - id: myCustomVolumeMount
    name: Data volume
    description: Mount /data into the container
    label: -v
    value: /data:/data
```

Please refer to the documentation of
the [docker run command](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/)
for a complete list of possible arguments.
