import Link from "next/link"

The most important thing for any data processing workflow is the data. In this tutorial, we use an aerial image provided by the <Link href="https://hvbg.hessen.de/">Hessische Verwaltung f√ºr Bodenmanagement und Geoinformation</Link> in Germany through https://gds.hessen.de. The image is free and can be used for any purpose.

Use the following link to download the full resolution image:

<div className="flex justify-center gap-3">
  <div>
    <img src={`${process.env.__NEXT_ROUTER_BASEPATH}/images/docs/aerial-image-segmentation/aerial-image-mini.jpg`} width="650" height="650" alt="Aerial image" loading="lazy" className="w-16 mt-0.5 mb-0" />
  </div>
  <div>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steep-wms/aerial-image-segmentation/1.0.0/data/dop20_32_475_5524_1_he.jpg</div>
</div>

In the following, we assume that the image has been saved to:

`/data/dop20_32_475_5524_1_he.jpg`

If you've downloaded the image to another location on your computer, make sure you modify the paths in the subsequent steps.
