It's now time to submit the workflow to Steep. Run the following command on your terminal:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows --data-binary @copy.yaml
```
</CodeContainer>

Steep will return a <DocsLink href="#submissions">submission object</DocsLink> with runtime information about the workflow including a unique ID. You can either open the web-based user interface at http://localhost:8080 or monitor the workflow execution on the command line:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/workflows/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>

Replace `[WORKFLOW ID]` with the unique ID returned by Steep after submitting the workflow.

When the workflow has finished, its <DocsLink href="#submission-status">status</DocsLink> will change to `SUCCESS`. You will find the file copy in the output directory, which is `/tmp/steep/out` by default. Steep creates a subdirectory for each workflow based in the workflow's ID:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
ls /tmp/steep/out/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>
