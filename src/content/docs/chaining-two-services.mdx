The following example workflow makes a copy of a file and then a copy of the
copy (i.e. the file is copied and the result is copied again). The workflow
contains two actions that share the same variable: `outputFile1` is used as
the output of the first action and as the input of the second action. Steep
executes them in sequence.

The service metadata for this workflow is the same as for the previous one.
