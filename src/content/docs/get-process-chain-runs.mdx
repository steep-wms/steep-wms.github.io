Return an array of all runs of a <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chain</DocsLink>.

A *run* is represented by an object containing a subset of the properties of a
process chain, namely `agentId`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `status`, `errorMessage`, and
`autoResumeAfter`. See the section on <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chains</DocsLink>
for more information about runs and these properties.

Runs are ordered by their run number from `1` to `n` where `n` is the total
number of runs (see process chain property `totalRuns`).
