Steep can provide metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). Besides
statistics about the Java Virtual Machine that Steep is running in, the
following metrics are included:

| Metric                            | Description
| --------------------------------- | -----------
| `steep_remote_agents`             | The number of registered remote agents
| `steep_controller_process_chains` | The number of generated process chains the controller is currently waiting for grouped by `submissionId`
| `steep_scheduler_process_chains`  | The number of process chains with a given <ScrollLink href="#process-chain-status">status</ScrollLink> (indicated by the label `status`)
| `steep_local_agent_retries`       | The total number of times an <ScrollLink href="#executables">executable</ScrollLink> with a given service ID (indicated by the label `serviceId`) had to be <ScrollLink href="#retry-policies">retried</ScrollLink>
| `steep_eventbus_compressedjson_messages` | Total number of compressed JSON messages sent/received over the event bus (label `operation` is either `sent` or `recv`)
| `steep_eventbus_compressedjson_bytes`    | Total number of compressed JSON bytes. Label `operation` is either `sent` or `recv`, and label `stage` is either `compressed` or `uncompressed`. Uncompressed bytes will be compressed before they are sent over the event bus, and received compressed bytes will be uncompressed.
| `steep_eventbus_compressedjson_time`     | Total number of milliseconds spent compressing or decompressing JSON (label `operation` is either `sent` or `recv` and specifies if sent bytes have been compressed or received bytes have been uncompressed)
