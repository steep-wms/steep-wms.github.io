import Link from "next/link"

The countdown script contains a <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">Shebang</Link> at the beginning, which tells your system's program loader to execute it through Node.js.

You just need to make it executable as follows:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
chmod +x countdown.js
```
</CodeContainer>
