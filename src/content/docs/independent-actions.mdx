While processing the workflow graph, Steep looks for independent sequences of actions and converts them to <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chains</DocsLink>. The following workflow contains four actions (two download actions and two extract actions). There are two output variables `o1` and `o2` that connect the services with each other.

<CodeContainer title="download-independent-actions.yaml">
```yaml generate-json
api: 4.6.0
actions:
  # Download source code of the Steep website
  - type: execute
    service: download
    inputs:
      - id: url
        value: https://github.com/steep-wms/steep-wms.github.io/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    outputs:
      - id: output_file
        var: o1

  # Download source code of Steep
  - type: execute
    service: download
    inputs:
      - id: url
        value: https://github.com/steep-wms/steep/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    outputs:
      - id: output_file
        var: o2

  # Extract source code of the Steep website
  - type: execute
    service: extract
    inputs:
      - id: input_file
        var: o1   # Output variable of the first download action
    outputs:
      - id: destination_directory
        var: website_output_directory
        store: true

  # Extract source code of Steep
  - type: execute
    service: extract
    inputs:
      - id: input_file
        var: o2   # Output variable of the second download action
    outputs:
      - id: destination_directory
        var: steep_output_directory
        store: true
```
</CodeContainer>

As described in the previous tutorial, Steep automatically detects dependencies between the actions. In this case, the first extract action depends on the output of the first download action (`o1`), and the second extract action depends on the second download action (`o2`).

Both pairs of actions are independent. Steep <DocsLink href="#workflow-scheduling">converts them to different process chains</DocsLink>, which can then be executed in parallel.
