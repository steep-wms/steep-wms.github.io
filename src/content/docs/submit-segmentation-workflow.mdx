Run the following command to submit the segmentation workflow to Steep:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows --data-binary @segment.yaml
```
</CodeContainer>

You can monitor the workflow execution in Steep's web UI. Note that it will take several minutes to complete.

Also, if you haven't done so already, the Docker images need to be pulled first. They have a total download size of about 8 GB, so depending on your Internet connection, downloading also may take a few minutes. Subsequent runs will be faster.

After the execution has finished, you will find the segmentation masks at `/data/out/[WORKFLOW ID]`.
