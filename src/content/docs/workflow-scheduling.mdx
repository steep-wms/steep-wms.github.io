Steep is a scientific workflow management system that can be used to control
the processing of very large data sets in a distributed environment.

A scientific workflow is typically represented by a directed acyclic graph that
describes how an input data set is processed by certain tasks in a given order
to produce a desired outcome. Such workflows can become very large with
hundreds up to several thousands of tasks processing data volumes ranging from
gigabytes to terabytes. The following figure shows a simple example of such a
workflow in an extended Petri Net notation proposed by
[van der Aalst and van Hee (2004)](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/7301.001.0001).

In this example, an input file is first processed by a task A. This task
produces two results. The first one is processed by task B whose result is in
turn sent to C. The second result of A is processed by D. The outcomes of C and
D are finally processed by task E.

In order to be able to schedule such a workflow in a distributed environment,
the graph has to be transformed to individual executable units. Steep follows a
hybrid scheduling approach that applies heuristics on the level of the workflow
graph and later on the level of individual executable units. We assume that
tasks that access the same data should be executed on the same machine to
reduce the communication overhead and to improve file reuse. We therefore
group tasks into so-called <ScrollLink href="#process-chains">process chains</ScrollLink>,
which are linear sequential lists (without branches and loops).

Steep transforms workflows to process chains in an iterative manner. In each
iteration, it finds the longest linear sequences of tasks and groups them to
process chains. The following animation shows how this works for our example
workflow:

  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: GenerateProcessChains }} />

Task A will be put into a process chain in iteration 1. Steep then schedules
the execution of this process chain. After the execution has finished,
Steep uses the results to produce a process chain containing B and C and
another one containing D. These process chains are then scheduled to be
executed in parallel. The results are finally used to generate the fourth
process chain containing task E, which is also scheduled for execution.
