<dt>`steep.logs.level`</dt>
<dd>
The default log level for all loggers (console as well as file-based)

**Valid values:** `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `OFF`.

**Default:** `DEBUG`
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.main.enabled`</dt>
<dd>
`true` if logging to the main log file should be enabled

**Default:** false
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.main.logFile`</dt>
<dd>
The name of the main log file

**Default:** `logs/steep.log`
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.enabled`</dt>
<dd>
`true` if main log files should be renamed every day. The file name will be
based on `steep.logs.main.logFile` and the file's date in the form
`YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g. `steep.2020-11-19.log`)

**Default:** `true`
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.maxDays`</dt>
<dd>
The maximum number of days' worth of main log files to keep

**Default**: 7
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.maxSize`</dt>
<dd>
The total maximum size of all main log files in bytes. Oldest log files will
deleted when this size is reached.

**Default**: 104857600 (100 MB)
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.processChains.enabled`</dt>
<dd>
`true` if the output of process chains should be logged separately to disk.
The output will still also appear on the console and in the main log file
(if enabled), but there, it's not separated by process chain. This feature
is useful if you want to record the output of individual process chains
and make it available through the <DocsLink href="#get-process-chain-logs">process chain logs endpoint</DocsLink>.

**Default:** `false`
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.processChains.path`</dt>
<dd>
The path where process chain logs will be stored. Individual files will
will be named after the ID of the corresponding process chain (e.g.
`aprsqz6d5f4aiwsdzbsq.log`). If a process chain has been executed more
than once (for example, due to a retry), the file name will include the
run number (e.g. `aprsqz6d5f4aiwsdzbsq.2.log`).

**Default:** `logs/processchains`
</dd>
<dt>`steep.logs.processChains.groupByPrefix`</dt>
<dd>
Set this configuration item to a value greater than `0` to group process
chain log files by prefix in subdirectories under the directory configured
through `steep.logs.processChains.path`. For example, if this configuration
item is set to `3`, Steep will create a separate subdirectory for all process
chains whose ID starts with the same three characters. The name of this
subdirectory will be these three characters. The process chains
`apomaokjbk3dmqovemwa` and `apomaokjbk3dmqovemsq` will be put into a
subdirectory called `apo`, and the process chain `ao344a53oyoqwhdelmna`
will be put into `ao3`. Note that in practice, `3` is a reasonable value,
which will create a new directory about every day. A value of `0` disables
grouping.

**Default:** 0
