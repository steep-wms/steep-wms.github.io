`steep.logs.level`

> The default log level for all loggers (console as well as file-based)

> **Valid values:** `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `OFF`.

> **Default:** `DEBUG`

`steep.logs.main.enabled`

> `true` if logging to the main log file should be enabled

> **Default:** false

`steep.logs.main.logFile`

> The name of the main log file

> **Default:** `logs/steep.log`

`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.enabled`

> `true` if main log files should be renamed every day. The file name will be
> based on `steep.logs.main.logFile` and the file's date in the form
> `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g. `steep.2020-11-19.log`)

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.maxDays`

> The maximum number of days' worth of main log files to keep

> **Default**: 7

`steep.logs.main.dailyRollover.maxSize`

> The total maximum size of all main log files in bytes. Oldest log files will
> deleted when this size is reached.

> **Default**: 104857600 (100 MB)

`steep.logs.processChains.enabled`

> `true` if the output of process chains should be logged separately to disk.
> The output will still also appear on the console and in the main log file
> (if enabled), but there, it's not separated by process chain. This feature
> is useful if you want to record the output of individual process chains
> and make it available through the <DocsLink href="#get-process-chain-logs">process chain logs endpoint</DocsLink>.

> **Default:** `false`

`steep.logs.processChains.path`

> The path where process chain logs will be stored. Individual files will
> will be named after the ID of the corresponding process chain (e.g.
> `aprsqz6d5f4aiwsdzbsq.log`). If a process chain has been executed more
than once (for example, due to a retry), the file name will include the
run number (e.g. `aprsqz6d5f4aiwsdzbsq.2.log`).

> **Default:** `logs/processchains`

`steep.logs.processChains.groupByPrefix`

> Set this configuration item to a value greater than `0` to group process
> chain log files by prefix in subdirectories under the directory configured
> through `steep.logs.processChains.path`. For example, if this configuration
> item is set to `3`, Steep will create a separate subdirectory for all process
> chains whose ID starts with the same three characters. The name of this
> subdirectory will be these three characters. The process chains
> `apomaokjbk3dmqovemwa` and `apomaokjbk3dmqovemsq` will be put into a
> subdirectory called `apo`, and the process chain `ao344a53oyoqwhdelmna`
> will be put into `ao3`. Note that in practice, `3` is a reasonable value,
> which will create a new directory about every day. A value of `0` disables
> grouping.

> **Default:** 0
