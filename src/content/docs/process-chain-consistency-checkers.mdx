A process chain consistency checker plugin is a function that checks if
an <DocsLink href="#execute-actions">execute action</DocsLink> can be added
to a <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chain</DocsLink> or if adding
it would lead to inconsistencies that render the process chain inexecutable.

The function is called before the execute action is converted to an
<DocsLink href="#executables">executable</DocsLink> and before it is added
to the process chain. It takes a list of executables that have been collected
so far during process chain generation, the execute action that is about to be
converted, the <DocsLink href="#workflows">workflow</DocsLink> from which
the process chain is being created, and a Vert.x instance.

It returns `true` if the execute action can safely be converted and added to
the list of executables to make up a new process chain, or `false` if adding
it would lead to a process chain that could not be executed later.

Steep will not discard actions that a consistency checker plugin has rejected.
Instead, it will try to add them to another process chain later. At this point,
the plugin will be called again.

If required, the function can be a suspend function.

| Additional properties       | Type  | |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ----------------
| dependsOn<br />*(optional)* | array | An optional list of names of other process chain consistency checker plugins that need to be executed before this plugin. If this property is not given, the order in which consistency checkers are applied to process chains is undefined.

| Function interface |
| ------------------ |

```kotlin
suspend fun myProcessChainConsistencyChecker(processChain: List<model.processchain.Executable>,
  action: model.workflow.ExecuteAction, workflow: model.workflow.Workflow,
  vertx: io.vertx.core.Vertx): Boolean
```

| Example descriptor |
| ------------------ |

```yaml
- name: myProcessChainConsistencyChecker
  type: processChainConsistencyChecker
  scriptFile: conf/plugins/myProcessChainConsistencyChecker.kt
```

| Example plugin script |
| --------------------- |

```kotlin
import io.vertx.core.Vertx
import model.processchain.Executable
import model.workflow.ExecuteAction
import model.workflow.Workflow

fun dummyProcessChainConsistencyChecker(processChain: List<Executable>,
    action: ExecuteAction, workflow: Workflow, vertx: Vertx): Boolean {
  // do not add a service more than once to a process chain
  return processChain.none { it.serviceId == action.service }
}
```
