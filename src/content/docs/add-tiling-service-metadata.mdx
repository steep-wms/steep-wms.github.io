import Link from "@/components/LinkFix"

Finally, open the file `conf/services/services.yaml` in your Steep installation and add the following <DocsLink href="#service-metadata">metadata</DocsLink> to register the service:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: tile
  name: Tiling
  description: Split an image into tiles
  path: tile.js   # replace this
  runtime: other

  parameters:
    - id: input_file
      name: Input image
      description: The input image to tile
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string

    - id: output_directory
      name: Output directory
      description: The directory where the tiles should be stored
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: directory

    - id: num_tiles
      name: Number of columns/rows
      description: >-
        The number of columns and rows to split the image into. A value of
        5 means the image will be split into 5x5 tiles.
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string
```
</CodeContainer>

Replace `tile.js` in the `path` attribute with the absolute path to `tile.js` on your system.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ You've created your first service from scratch and integrated into Steep. It can now be called via its ID as seen in the previous tutorials.
