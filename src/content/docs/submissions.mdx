A *submission* is created when you submit a <ScrollLink href="#workflows">workflow</ScrollLink>
through the <ScrollLink href="#get-submissions">`/workflows`</ScrollLink> endpoint. It contains information
about the workflow execution such as the start and end time as well as the
current <ScrollLink href="#submission-status">status</ScrollLink>.

| workflow<br/>*(required)*               | object | The submitted <ScrollLink href="#workflows">workflow</ScrollLink>
| startTime<br/>*(optional)*              | string | An ISO 8601 timestamp denoting the date and time when the workflow execution was started. May be `null` if the execution has not started yet.

| cancelledProcessChains<br/>*(required)* | number | The number of process chains that have been cancelled
| succeededProcessChains<br/>*(required)* | number | The number of process chains that have finished successfully
| failedProcessChains<br/>*(required)*    | number | The number of process chains whose execution has failed
