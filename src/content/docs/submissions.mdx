A *submission* is created when you submit a <DocsLink href="#workflows">workflow</DocsLink>
through the <DocsLink href="#get-submissions">`/workflows`</DocsLink> endpoint. It contains information
about the workflow execution such as the start and end time as well as the
current <DocsLink href="#submission-status">status</DocsLink>.

| Property                                | Type   | Description
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | -----------
| id<br/>*(required)*                     | string | Unique submission identifier
| name<br/>*(optional)*                   | string | An optional human-readable submission name. The value is derived from the submitted <DocsLink href="#workflows">workflow</DocsLink>'s name if it has any.
| workflow<br/>*(required)*               | object | The submitted <DocsLink href="#workflows">workflow</DocsLink>
| priority<br />*(optional)*              | number | A priority used during scheduling. Process chains generated from submissions with higher priorities will be scheduled before those with lower priorities. Negative values are allowed. The value is derived from the submitted <DocsLink href="#workflows">workflow</DocsLink> but <DocsLink href="#put-submission">can be overridden</DocsLink>. The submission's priority always takes precedence over the workflow's priority when generating process chains.
| startTime<br/>*(optional)*              | string | An ISO 8601 timestamp denoting the date and time when the workflow execution was started. May be `null` if the execution has not started yet.
| endTime<br/>*(optional)*                | string | An ISO 8601 timestamp denoting the date and time when the workflow execution finished. May be `null` if the execution has not finished yet.
| status<br/>*(required)*                 | string | The current <DocsLink href="#submission-status">status</DocsLink> of the submission
| requiredCapabilities<br/>*(required)*   | array  | A set of strings specifying capabilities a host system must provide to be able to execute this workflow. See also <DocsLink href="#setups">setups</DocsLink>.
| source<br/>*(optional)*                 | string | The original, unaltered workflow source as it was submitted through the <DocsLink href="#get-submissions">`/workflows`</DocsLink> endpoint. May be `null` if the workflow was not submitted through the endpoint or if the source is unavailable.
| runningProcessChains<br/>*(required)*   | number | The number of <DocsLink href="#process-chains">process chains</DocsLink> currently being executed
| pausedProcessChains<br/>*(required)*    | number | The number of process chains whose execution is currently paused
| cancelledProcessChains<br/>*(required)* | number | The number of process chains that have been cancelled
| succeededProcessChains<br/>*(required)* | number | The number of process chains that have finished successfully
| failedProcessChains<br/>*(required)*    | number | The number of process chains whose execution has failed
| totalProcessChains<br/>*(required)*     | number | The current total number of process chains in this submission. May increase during execution when new process chains are generated.
| results<br/>*(optional)*                | object | If `status` is `SUCCESS` or `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, this property contains the list of workflow result files grouped by their output variable ID. Otherwise, it is `null`.
| errorMessage<br/>*(optional)*           | string | If `status` is `ERROR`, this property contains a human-readable error message. Otherwise, it is `null`.
