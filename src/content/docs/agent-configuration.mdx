import DocsLink from "components/DocsLink"

`steep.agent.enabled`

> `true` if this Steep instance should be able to execute process chains (i.e.
> if one or more agents should be deployed)

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.agent.instances`

> The number of agents that should be deployed within this Steep instance (i.e.
> how many <DocsLink href="#executables">executables</DocsLink> the Steep
> instance can run in parallel)

> **Default:** 1

`steep.agent.id`

> Unique identifier for the first agent instance deployed. Subsequent agent
> instances will have a consecutive number appended to their IDs.

> **Default:** (an automatically generated unique ID)

`steep.agent.capabilities`

> List of capabilities that the agents provide

> **Default:** `[]` (empty list)

`steep.agent.autoShutdownTimeout`

> The time any agent instance can remain idle until Steep shuts itself down
> gracefully (specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>).
> By default, this value is `0s`, which means Steep never shuts itself down.

> **Default:** 0s

`steep.agent.busyTimeout`

> The time that should pass before an idle agent decides that it is not busy
> anymore (specified as a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink>).
> Normally, the scheduler allocates an agent, sends it a process chain, and
> then deallocates it after the process chain execution has finished. This value
> is important if the scheduler crashes while the process chain is being
> executed and does not deallocate the agent anymore. In this case, the agent
> deallocates itself after the configured time has passed.

> **Default:** 1m

`steep.agent.outputLinesToCollect`

> The number of output lines to collect at most from each executed service
> (also applies to error output)

> **Default:** 100
