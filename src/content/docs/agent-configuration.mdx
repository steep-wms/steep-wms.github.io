`steep.agent.enabled`

> `true` if this Steep instance should be able to execute process chains (i.e.
> if an agent should be deployed)

> **Default:** `true`

`steep.agent.id`

> Unique identifier of this agent instance

> **Default:** An automatically generated unique ID

`steep.agent.capabilities`

> List of capabilities that this agent provides

> **Default:** `[]` (empty list)

`steep.agent.autoShutdownTimeoutMinutes`

> The number of minutes an agent should remain idle until it shuts itself down
> gracefully. By default, this value is `0`, which means the agent never shuts
> itself down.

> **Default:** 0

`steep.agent.busyTimeoutSeconds`

> The number of seconds that should pass before an idle agent decides that it
> is not busy anymore. Normally, the scheduler allocates and agent, sends it a
> process chain, and then deallocates it after the process chain execution has
> finished. This value is important, if the scheduler crashes while the
> process chain is being executed and does not deallocate the agent anymore. In
> this case, the agent deallocates itself after the configured time has passed.

> **Default:** 60

`steep.agent.outputLinesToCollect`

> The number of output lines to collect at most from each executed service
> (also applies to error output)

> **Default:** 100
