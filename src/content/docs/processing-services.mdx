Steep is very flexible and allows a wide range of processing services (or
microservices) to be integrated. A typical processing service is a program
that reads one or more input files and writes one or more output files. The
program may also accept generic parameters. The service can be implemented in
any programming language (as long as the binary or script is executable on the
machine the Steep agent is running) or can be wrapped in a Docker container.

For a seamless integration, a processing service should adhere to the following
guidelines:

* Every processing service should be a microservice. It should run in
  its own process and serve one specific purpose.
* As Steep needs to call the service in a distributed environment, it should
  not have a graphical user interface or require any human interaction during
  the runtime. Suitable services are command-line applications that accept
  arguments to specify input files, output files, and parameters.
* The service should read from input files, process the data, write results to
  output files, and then exit. It should not run continuously like a web
  service. If you need to integrate a web service in your workflow, we
  recommend using the `curl` command or something similar.
* Steep does not require the processing services to implement a specific
  interface. Instead, the service's input and output parameters should be
  described in a special data model called <ScrollLink href="#service-metadata">service metadata</ScrollLink>.
* According to common conventions for exit codes, a processing service should
  return 0 (zero) upon successful execution and any number but zero in case an
  error has occurred (e.g. 1, 2, 128, 255, etc.).
* In order to ensure deterministic workflow exceutions, services should be
  stateless and idempotent. This means that every execution of a service with
  the same input data and the same set of parameters should produce the same
  result.
