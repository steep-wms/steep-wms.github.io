import ScrollLink from "components/ScrollLink"

Update a <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission</ScrollLink>. The request
body is a JSON object with the <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission properties</ScrollLink>
to update. At the moment, only the `status` and `priority` properties can be updated.

If the operation was successful, the response body contains
the updated submission without the properties `workflow`, `results`, and
`errorMessage`.

Notes:
* You can use this endpoint to cancel the execution of a submission (see
  example below).
* If you update a submission's priority, the priorities of all process chains 
  that belong to this submission and have a <ScrollLink href="#process-chain-status">status</ScrollLink>
  of either `REGISTERED` or `RUNNING` will be updated too. Also, all process
  chains generated from this submission in the future will receive the updated
  priority. Finished process chains will not be modified.
