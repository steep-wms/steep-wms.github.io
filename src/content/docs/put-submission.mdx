import ScrollLink from "components/ScrollLink"

Update a <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission</ScrollLink>. The request
body is a JSON object with the <ScrollLink href="#submissions">submission properties</ScrollLink>
to update. At the moment, only the `status` property can be updated.

If the operation was successful, the response body contains
the updated submission without the properties `workflow`, `results`, and
`errorMessage`.

Note: You can use this endpoint to cancel the execution of a submission (see
example below).
