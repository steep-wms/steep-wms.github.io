Finally, modify the service metadata you've added <DocsLink href="#add-tiling-service-metadata">above</DocsLink> and change the `path` to the name of the built Docker image `tiling-service`. Also change `runtime` to `docker`.

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml /tiling-service/ /docker/
- id: tile
  name: Tiling
  description: Split an image into tiles
  path: tiling-service
  runtime: docker

  ...
```
</CodeContainer>

If you want to deploy your image to multiple machines in your distributed environment, you'll most likely want to push your image into a Docker registry. Please refer to the <Link href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/">Docker documentation</Link> for more information.
