A for-each action has an input, a list of sub-actions, and an output. It clones
the sub-actions as many times as there are items in its input, executes the
actions, and then collects the results in the output.

Although the action is called 'for-each', the execution order of the
sub-actions is undefined (i.e. the execution is non-sequential and
non-deterministic). Instead, Steep always tries to execute as many sub-actions
as possible in parallel.

For-each actions may contain execute actions but also nested for-each actions.

| Property                       | Type   | Description
| ------------------------------ | ------ | -----------
| id<br />*(optional)*           | string | An optional string uniquely identifying the action within the workflow. If not given, a random identifier will be generated.
| type<br/>*(required)*          | string | The type of the action. Must be `"for"`.
| input<br/>*(required)*         | string | The ID of a variable containing the items to which to apply the sub-actions
| enumerator<br/>*(required)*    | string | The ID of a variable that holds the current value from `input` for each iteration
| output<br/>*(optional)*        | string | The ID of a variable that will collect output values from all iterations (see `yieldToOutput`)
| actions<br/>*(optional)*       | array  | An array of sub-actions to execute in each iteration
| yieldToOutput<br/>*(optional)* | string | The ID of a sub-action's output variable whose value should be appended to the for-each action's `output`
| yieldToInput<br/>*(optional)*  | string | The ID of a sub-action's output variable whose value should be appended to the for-each action's `input` to generate further iterations
