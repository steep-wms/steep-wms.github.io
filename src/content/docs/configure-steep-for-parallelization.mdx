In order to enable parallelization, you either have to configure multiple agents or launch more than one Steep instance. The first approach allows you to run multiple process chains in parallel on the same machine (vertical scaling), while the second one enables horizontal scaling across several machines in a distributed environment. Both approaches can be combined.
