Similar to the previous tutorials, we need to add metadata for the two services. Open the file `conf/services/services.yaml` and add the following code to it to describe the tiling service:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: tile
  name: Tiling
  description: Split an image into tiles
  path: ghcr.io/steep-wms/aerial-image-segmentation/tiling-service:1.0.0
  runtime: docker

  parameters:
    - id: input_file
      name: Input image
      description: The input image to tile
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string

    - id: output_directory
      name: Output directory
      description: The directory where the tiles should be stored
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: directory

    - id: num_tiles
      name: Number of columns/rows
      description: >-
        The number of columns and rows to split the image into. A value of
        5 means the image will be split into 5x5 tiles.
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string
```
</CodeContainer>

The service has three parameters: one for the input image file, one for the output directory where the tiles will be stored, and one specifying the number of columns and rows to split the image into. Regarding the latter, a value of 5 means the image will be split into 5x5 (=25) tiles.

As the service is provided as a pre-compiled <Link href="https://github.com/steep-wms/aerial-image-segmentation">Docker image on GitHub</Link>, we set the attribute `path` to the Docker image name and the attribute `runtime` to `docker`.

Now, add the metadata for the segmentation service:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: segment
  name: Image segmentation
  description: Segment geospatial data with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
  path: ghcr.io/steep-wms/aerial-image-segmentation/segmentation-service:1.0.0
  runtime: docker

  parameters:
    - id: input_file
      name: Input image
      description: The input image to segment
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string

    - id: output_file
      name: Output image
      description: Output image with masks
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: string
      fileSuffix: .jpg
```
</CodeContainer>

The service has just two parameters: one for the image to segment and one for the filename of the output segmentation mask. We set the `fileSuffix` of the output parameter to `.jpg` to make sure the filename will be generated with the right extension.
