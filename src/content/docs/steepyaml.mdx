The file `steep.yaml` contains the main configuration of Steep. This page
describes all configuration keys and values you can set.

Note that keys are specified using the dot notation. You can use them as
they are given here or use YAML notation instead. For example, the following
configuration item

```yaml
steep.cluster.eventBus.publicPort: 41187
```

is identical to:

```yaml
steep:
  cluster:
    eventBus:
      publicPort: 41187
```

You may override items in your configuration file with environment variables.
This is particularly useful if you are using Steep inside a Docker container.
The environment variables use a slightly different naming scheme. All variables
are in capital letters and dots are replaced by underscores. For example,
the configuration key `steep.http.host` becomes `STEEP_HTTP_HOST` and
`steep.cluster.eventBus.publicPort` becomes `STEEP_CLUSTER_EVENTBUS_PUBLICPORT`.
You may use YAML syntax to specify environment variable values. For example,
the array `steep.agent.capabilities` can be specified as follows:

```shell
STEEP_AGENT_CAPABILITIES='["docker", "python"]'
```
