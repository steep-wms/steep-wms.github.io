Choose from one of the following options to download Steep:

<DownloadButtons />

If you've downloaded the binary package of Steep, extract the ZIP file and run the
start script:

<RunBinary />

Or, start the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/steep/steep) as
follows:

<RunDocker />

After a few seconds, you can access Steep's web interface on
http://localhost:8080/.

We will now submit a simple workflow to test if Steep is running correctly. The
workflow consists of a single execute action that sleeps for 10 seconds and
then quits. Run the following command:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows -d 'api: 4.6.0
actions:
  - type: execute
    service: sleep
    inputs:
      - id: seconds
        value: 10'
```
</CodeContainer>

The command will return the ID of the submitted workflow. You can monitor the
execution in the web interface or by issuing the following command:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/workflows/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>

Replace `[WORKFLOW ID]` with the returned ID.

*Congratulations! You've successfully installed Steep and ran your first workflow.* ðŸŽ‰
