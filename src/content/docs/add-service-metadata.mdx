Let's assume we want to create a workflow that creates a copy of a file. For this, we can use the `cp` command, which is built-in into all UNIX distributions (under Windows, you can use the `copy` command instead). Open the file `conf/services/services.yaml` and add the following service metadata:

<CodeContainer title="conf/services/services.yaml">
```yaml
- id: cp
  name: Copy
  description: Create a copy of a file
  path: cp
  runtime: other

  parameters:
    - id: input_file
      name: Input file name
      description: The file to copy
      type: input
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: file

    - id: output_file
      name: Output file name
      description: The target to where the file will be copied
      type: output
      cardinality: 1..1
      dataType: file
```
</CodeContainer>

This metadata describes a service with the ID `cp`. It has a human-readable `name` and `description`. The `path` attribute specifies the path to the service's executable. Since the *cp* command is built-in, we can just use `cp` here (replace this with `copy` under Windows).

The service has two parameters, `input_file` and `output_file`, which represent the service's input and output parameters, respectively. Both have a cardinality of `1..1`, which means they are mandatory. They also have human-readable names and descriptions.

<Admonition>
The default distribution of Steep already contains metadata for this service, so you actually don't need to do anything here.
