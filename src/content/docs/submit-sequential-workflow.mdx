Run the following command on your terminal to submit the new workflow to Steep:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows --data-binary @download.yaml
```
</CodeContainer>

Similar to the first tutorial, Steep will return a workflow ID.

Wait until the workflow has finished. If it was successful, you will find the extracted archive in Steep's output directory:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
ls /tmp/steep/out/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>

Since we did not specify the `store` flag for the `download` action, the downloaded `.zip` file will be stored in Steep's temporary directory, which is `/tmp` by default:

<CodeContainer title="Terminal">
```shell
ls /tmp/[WORKFLOW ID]
```
</CodeContainer>

Again, replace `[WORKFLOW ID]` with the ID returned by Steep.
