An endpoint that can be used by external applications at regular intervals to
monitor Steep's health, i.e. to check if it works correctly and if the
underlying database as well as all remote agents are reachable.

The response is a JSON object, which will always contain the attribute `health`.
This attribute can be either `true` if Steep works correctly or `false` if
some error has occurred. Apart from that, the response *may* contain additional
information about data stored in the database (such as the number of submissions)
as well as information about remote agents. However, these attributes are not
defined and *may* change in future versions.
