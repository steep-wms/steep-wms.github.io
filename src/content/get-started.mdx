## Download and get started

Choose from one of the following options to download Steep:

<DownloadButtons />

If you downloaded the binary package of Steep, extract the ZIP file and run the
start script:

<pre>
  <code className="hljs language-bash"><span className="hljs-built_in">cd</span> steep-{pkg.version}
  bin/steep</code>
</pre>

Or, start the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/steep/steep) as
follows:

<pre>
  <code className="hljs language-bash">docker run --name steep -d --rm -p 8080:8080 \\
    {`    `}-e STEEP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 steep/steep:{pkg.version}</code>
</pre>

After a few seconds, you can access Steep's web interface on
http://localhost:8080/.

We will now submit a simple workflow to test if Steep is running correctly. The
workflow consists of a single execute action that sleeps for 10 seconds and
then quits. Execute the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows -d 'api: 4.2.0
vars:
  - id: sleep_seconds
    value: 10
actions:
  - type: execute
    service: sleep
    inputs:
      - id: seconds
        var: sleep_seconds'
```

The command will return the ID of the submitted workflow. You can monitor the
execution in the web interface or by issuing the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/workflows/<workflow-id>
```

Replace `<workflow-id>` with the returned ID.

*Congratulations! You successfully installed Steep and ran your first workflow.*
