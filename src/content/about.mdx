## About

Steep's development is led by the competence center for
[Spatial Information Management](https://igd.fraunhofer.de/en/competences/technologies/spatial-information-management)
of the [Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD](https://igd.fraunhofer.de/)
in Darmstadt, Germany. *Fraunhofer IGD* is the international leading research
institution for applied visual computing. The competence center for *Spatial
Information Management* offers expertise and innovative technologies that
enable successful communication and efficient cooperation with the help of
geographic information.

*Steep* was initially developed within the research project "IQmulus" (A
High-volume Fusion and Analysis Platform for Geospatial Point Clouds, Coverages
and Volumetric Data Sets) funded from the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Programme of the
European Commission, call identifier FP7-ICT-2011-8, under the Grant agreement
no. 318787 from 2012 to 2016. It was previously called the 'IQmulus JobManager'
or just the 'JobManager'.

This presentation was given by Michel Krämer at the DATA conference 2020. He presented
his paper entitled <ScrollLink href="#publications">"Capability-based scheduling of scientific workflows in the cloud"</ScrollLink>.
Michel talked about Steep's software architecture and its scheduling
algorithm that assigns process chains to virtual machines.
