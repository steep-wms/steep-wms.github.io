A retry policy specifies how often the execution of a workflow action should be
retried in case of an error. Retry policies can be specified per service in 
the <DocsLink href="#service-metadata">service metadata</DocsLink> or
per <DocsLink href="#execute-actions">executable action</DocsLink> in the
workflow.

| Property                            | Type     | Description
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -----------
| maxAttempts<br/>*(optional)*        | number   | The maximum number of attempts to perform. This includes the initial attempt. For example, a value of `3` means 1 initial attempt and 2 retries. The default value is `1`. A value of `-1` means an unlimited (infinite) number of attempts. `0` means there will be no attempt at all (the service or action will be skipped).
| delay<br/>*(optional)*              | <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink> | The amount of time that should pass between two attempts. The default is `0`, which means the operation will be retried immediately.
| exponentialBackoff<br/>*(optional)* | number   | A factor for an exponential backoff (see description below)
| maxDelay<br/>*(optional)*           | <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink> | The maximum amount of time that should pass between two attempts. Only applies if `exponentialBackoff` is larger than `1`. By default, there is no upper limit.

<h6>Exponential backoff:</h6>

The exponential backoff factor can be used to gradually increase the `delay`.
The actual delay between two attempts will be calculated as follows:

```java
actualDelay = min(delay * pow(exponentialBackoff, nAttempt - 1), maxDelay)
```

For example, if `delay` equals `1s`, `exponentialBackoff` equals `2`, and
`maxDelay` equals `10s`, the following actual delays will apply:

* Delay after attempt 1

  `min(1s * pow(2, 0), 10s) = 1s`

* Delay after attempt 2:

  `min(1s * pow(2, 1), 10s) = 2s`

* Delay after attempt 3:

  `min(1s * pow(2, 2), 10s) = 4s`

* Delay after attempt 4:

  `min(1s * pow(2, 3), 10s) = 8s`

* Delay after attempt 5:

  `min(1s * pow(2, 4), 10s) = 10s`

* Delay after attempt 6:

  `min(1s * pow(2, 4), 10s) = 10s`

The default value is `1`, which means there is no backoff and the actual
delay always equals the specified one.
