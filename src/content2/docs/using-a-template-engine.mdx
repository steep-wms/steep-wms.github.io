You can use a template engine in all of Steep's YAML-based configuration files
(`steep.yaml`, `setups.yaml`, `services.yaml`, etc.) to dynamically generate a
configuration at startup.

You have to explicitly enable this feature by adding front matter to your YAML
file and setting the attribute `template` to `true`:

```yaml
---
template: true
---
```

Steep uses <a href="https://pebbletemplates.io/">Pebble Templates</a> to compile
your configuration files. Please refer to their website for a full documentation
on the tags, functions, and filters you can use.

Within your template, you may access the following variables:

| Variable       | Description
| -------------- | -----------
| `env`          | A dictionary of environment variables. Use subscript notation (`[]`) to access its contents. Example: `{{ env["PATH"] }}`
| `config`       | A dictionary of configuration properties. This variable is *not* available in `steep.yaml` (or any override configuration file). Use subscript notation (`[]`) to access its contents. Example: `{{ config["steep.cluster.hazelcast.publicAddress"] }}`

Here is a full example of a `setups.yaml` file that uses the templating feature
to create two setups with the same parameters, an image name from an environment
variable, but different availability zones:

```yaml
---
template: true
---

{% for az in ["us-east-1", "eu-central-1"] %}
- id: my_setup_{{ az }}
  flavor: m4.2xlarge
  availabilityZone: {{ az }}
  imageName: {{ env["MY_SETUP_IMAGE_NAME"] }
  blockDeviceSizeGb: 50
  minVMs: 0
  maxVMs: 10
{% endfor %}
```
