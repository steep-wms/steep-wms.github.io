A timeout policy defines how long a service or an executable may run before it
is automatically cancelled or aborted (with an error). Timeout policies can be
specified with the `maxInactivity`, `maxRuntime` and `deadline` attributes, either
per service in the <DocsLink href="#service-metadata">service metadata</DocsLink>
or per <DocsLink href="#execute-actions">executable action</DocsLink> in the
workflow.

A timeout policy is either a string or an object. If it is a string, it
represents a <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink> specifying
a maximum amount of time until the execution is cancelled.

If specified as an object, the timeout policy has the following properties:

| Property                        | Type     | Description
| ------------------------------- | -------- | -----------
| timeout                         | <DocsLink href="#durations">duration</DocsLink> | The maximum amount of time that may pass until the execution is cancelled or aborted.
| errorOnTimeout<br/>*(optional)* | boolean   | `true` if an execution that is aborted due to a timeout should lead to an error (i.e. if the process chain's <DocsLink href="#process-chain-status">status</DocsLink> should be set to `ERROR`). `false` if it should just be cancelled (process chain status `CANCELLED`). By default, the execution will be cancelled.

Multiple timeout policies can be combined. For example, a service may be cancelled after 5 minutes of inactivity and aborted with an error if its total execution takes longer than 1 hour.
