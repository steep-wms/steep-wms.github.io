## Download and get started

In order to use Steep, you need to download it first. Choose from one of the
following options:

<a href="https://github.com/steep-wms/steep/releases/download/v5.0.1/steep-5.0.1.zip" class="btn btn-primary"><i data-feather="download"></i> Download Steep 5.0.1 (binaries)</a>
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/steep/steep/" class="btn btn-secondary">{% simpleIcon "docker" %} Docker image</a>
<a href="https://github.com/steep-wms/steep" class="btn btn-secondary"><i data-feather="github"></i> Source code</a>

If you downloaded the binary package of Steep, extract the ZIP file and run the
start script:

    cd steep-5.0.1
    bin/steep

Or, start the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/steep/steep) as
follows:

    docker run --name steep -d --rm -p 8080:8080 \
        -e STEEP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 steep/steep:unstable

After a few seconds, you should be able to access Steep's web interface on
<http://localhost:8080/>.

We will now submit a simple workflow to test if Steep is running correctly. The
workflow consists of a single `sleep` command that waits for 10 seconds and
then quits. Execute the following command:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows -d 'api: 4.0.0
    vars:
      - id: sleep_seconds
        value: 10
    actions:
      - type: execute
        service: sleep
        parameters:
          - id: seconds
            var: sleep_seconds'

The command will return the ID of the submitted workflow. You can monitor the
execution in the web interface or by issuing the following command:

    curl http://localhost:8080/workflows/<workflow-id>

Replace `<workflow-id>` by the returned ID.

*Congratulations! You successfully installed Steep and ran your first workflow.*
